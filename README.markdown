GOSU RPG PROTOTYPE
==================

[Gosu-based](http://www.libgosu.org/) RPG game written in Ruby.

Currently serves as prove of concept for me for developing games with Gosu.
Experience is always good.

Following concepts have been implemented:

 * Animated sprites
 * Map scrolling and dynamic loading 
 * Game's protagonist with sets of RPG characteristics (hp, mana, exp etc)
 * Simple level modification / construction / object spawning
 * Protagonist collision detection
 * Multi layer static map building
 * Sample enemy
   * Static monster with line of sight detection and spell construction
 * Spell reloading time
 * Spell collision detection
 * Sample items (potions etc)
 * Song loading.

To run it presently you have to execute ruby game.rb command.
A LOT has to be done.
